Hi! I am a researcher in Theoretical Neuroscience. I use neural network models, dynamical systems and statistical tools such as dimensionality reduction for understanding brain computations.

I obtained my PhD at <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">École Normale Supérieure</font> (Paris), under the supervision of S. Ostojic.
I then joined the <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</font> (UCL), where I worked as a post-doctoral fellow together with by P. Latham. In those years, I developed mathematical tools to investigate how computations emerge from the synaptic connectivity and activity of artificial and biological circuits.
I am currently a postdoc at the <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">Champalimaud Center for the Unknown</font> (Lisbon), where I am working on deciphering large-scale neural datasets, and I am advised by C. Machens. I am also a <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">Simons Foundation Independence Fellow</font>.
